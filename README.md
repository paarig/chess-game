# chess-game

# This chess game project was created in May 2016 by Nate Fischer and me.
# This project uses JavaFX for a front end and Java for a back end.
# The program uses an 8 x 8 array to hold integers that correspond to Piece objects, with each Piece having its own move logic.
# Negative and positive integers are used to differentiate between black and white pieces and logic for checks and captures
# have been programmed into the application.
# This desktop Java application allows for two player chess play on one device.
# To run the application, download the jar file in the dist folder and click on it to begin play.
